### Presence Changer

kinda misleading for now but eh
- Allows you to change or turn off CVR's built in Discord rich presence.

Currently implemented:
- Change Application ID
- Disable the rich presence

Coming later:
- Large/Small Image Keys & Text, persist after game changes them again (world switch, etc)
- String templating and Buttons may be implemented in the future if I have time. Pull Requests are always welcome.

### [OBS Control](https://github.com/aniiiiiimal/obscontrol)
An WIP port of my VRChat mod, which is a somewhat-port of a beat saber mod with the same name\
OBSControl is hosted in its own repository [here](https://github.com/aniiiiiimal/obscontrol) - on the `cvr` branch (not pushed to github yet)

### RestartButton
Press `Equals` to restart the game. Currently doesn't work because it detects the newly opened game as a duplicate instance.
